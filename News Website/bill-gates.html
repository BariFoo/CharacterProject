Then I took it out again maybe a month ago, and it finally started to sink in. Now I think I even like it better than <em>OK Computer</em>.” Gates said he still hasn't gotten around to picking up <em>Amnesiac.</em></p>	<p>This report was written by <a href="http://www.theonion.com" target="_blank">The Onion</a></p></body></html>
