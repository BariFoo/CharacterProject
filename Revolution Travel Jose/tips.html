		<h1>Trip Planning Tips</h1>
		<p>If you follow some of these tips, we're sure your next vacation will go smoother. And that means more fun and bigger smiles. We're here to make your vacation happier :)</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Don't borrow guide books. Buy the most up-to-date version. Instead of saving a few dollars, you'll be wasting valuable time on your vacation as you plan events around places that may be closed or altered. Good guidebooks are often an essential tool for a great vacation and not a place you should skimp on.</li>
		<li>Packing List: In the weeks (not days, procrastinators!) before your trip, keep a list handy. As you think of things you want to bring along, write them down. This way it will be a more comprehensive list. Then use it as the basis for lists on future vacations to save time.</li>
		<li>Bring a few extra Quart size Ziploc bags. You need them to get liquids through security, but they are also useful for putting wallets into for water activities and more.</li>
		<li>Travel sized shampoos, soaps, etc. are essential these days since liquids need to fit into a Quart sized Ziploc. Each night pack away the ones provided by your hotel. The next day they'll replenish them. Do this each night and you'll have enough for your next trip!</li>
